# Flying Training and Approval Process

Before you can fly multirotor drones independently at DTRG, you must complete flight training and receive approval. This page outlines the requirements and process.

## Overview

All students and members working with multirotor drones must demonstrate competency before being approved for solo flight operations. This ensures safety for people, equipment, and property.

## Training Requirements

### Supervised Training
Until approved for solo flight, you must:
- Practice **only with a trainer pilot present**
- Use **designated training drones only** (see [Training Drones](../uavs/Training-Drones))
- Follow all instructions from your trainer pilot

### Best Training Opportunities

**Biweekly Socials** (PRIMARY OPTION)
- **When**: Organized each semester (check WhatsApp/email for current schedule)
- **Where**: Typically in the Motion Capture Lab; sometimes at the park during summer
- **What**: Supervised flying practice with experienced pilots, plus socializing with the team
- **Special Events**: Sometimes themed events like Christmas socials
- **How**: Just show up and ask for flight training

**Self-Practice with Training Drones** (LIMITED)
- You may practice **at your discretion** with training drones ONLY
- Must still follow all safety guidelines
- Recommended: [LOCATION RESTRICTIONS TO BE FILLED]
- See [Training Drones](../uavs/Training-Drones) for which drones qualify
