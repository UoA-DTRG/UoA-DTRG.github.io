# Safety Guidelines

**SAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY** - These guidelines must be followed by all DTRG members at all times.

**CRITICAL**: Violation of safety procedures may result in immediate suspension of lab privileges.

## Emergency Procedures

### In Case of Emergency
1. **STOP ALL OPERATIONS** immediately
2. **Ensure personal safety** first
3. **Alert others** in the area
4. **Contact emergency services** if required (111 in New Zealand)
5. **Report to supervisor** as soon as safe to do so

- **First Aid**: [Insert number]  
- **Lab Supervisor**: [Insert contact]
- **DTRG Safety Officer**: [Insert contact]

## Electrical Safety

### Battery Handling
#### LiPo Battery Safety - CRITICAL
- **Never leave batteries unattended** while charging
- **Use proper LiPo charging bags** or fireproof containers
- **Check voltage before use** - never use damaged batteries
- **Store at storage voltage** (3.8V per cell) for long periods
- **Dispose properly** - never throw in regular trash

#### Charging Procedures
1. **Inspect battery** for damage before charging
2. **Set correct parameters** (cell count, charge rate)
3. **Monitor during charging** - never leave unattended
4. **Charge in designated area** with fire safety equipment nearby
5. **Use smoke detectors** and fire extinguishers where available

### Electrical Equipment
- **Inspect all equipment** before use
- **Report damaged cables** or connectors immediately
- **Keep work area clean** and organized
- **Use proper tools** for electrical work
- **Never work on live circuits** unless specifically trained

## Flight Operations Safety

### Pre-Flight Requirements
#### MANDATORY Checks
- [ ] **Weather conditions** suitable for flight
- [ ] **Airspace clearance** obtained if required
- [ ] **Flight area clear** of people and obstacles
- [ ] **Emergency procedures** reviewed with team
- [ ] **First aid kit** available on site
- [ ] **Communication** with air traffic control if required

#### Equipment Inspection
- [ ] **Visual inspection** of aircraft structure
- [ ] **Propeller security** and condition
- [ ] **Battery voltage** and connection security
- [ ] **Control surface** movement and response
- [ ] **GPS lock** and sensor calibration
- [ ] **Emergency shutdown** procedures tested

### Flight Area Safety
#### Minimum Safety Distances
- **30 meters** from people not involved in operation
- **50 meters** from buildings and vehicles
- **100 meters** from airports and controlled airspace
- **Follow local regulations** and university policies

#### Weather Limitations
- **No flight in rain** or wet conditions
- **Wind speed less than 15 m/s** for most aircraft
- **Good visibility** (minimum 5 km)
- **No thunderstorms** in area

### During Flight Operations
- **Designated pilot** in command at all times
- **Visual observer** maintaining line of sight
- **Clear communication** between team members
- **Emergency landing area** identified
- **Ready to take manual control** if needed

## Workshop and Lab Safety

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
#### Required PPE
- **Safety glasses** when using tools or chemicals
- **Closed-toe shoes** at all times in lab
- **Long pants** recommended for workshop activities
- **Hearing protection** when using loud equipment

#### Prohibited Items
- **Loose clothing** near rotating equipment
- **Jewelry** that could catch in machinery
- **Open-toed shoes** or sandals
- **Shorts** in workshop areas

### Tool and Equipment Safety
#### Power Tools
- **Training required** before use
- **Inspect before use** - check for damage
- **Proper technique** and stance
- **Disconnect power** when changing bits or blades
- **Clean and store properly** after use

#### Soldering and Electronics
- **Use fume extraction** or work in ventilated area
- **Handle hot equipment** with care
- **Keep work area clean** and organized
- **Use ESD protection** when required
- **Proper disposal** of chemical waste

## General Lab Safety

### Access and Security
- **Authorized personnel only** in lab areas
- **Sign in/out** as required
- **Secure equipment** when leaving
- **Report security concerns** immediately
- **Follow university access policies**

### Housekeeping
- **Clean up after yourself** 
- **Return tools** to designated locations

- **Keep emergency exits** clear
- **Organize cables** to prevent tripping hazards

## Risk Assessment

### Before Starting Any Activity

2. **Assess risk level** (low, medium, high)
3. **Implement control measures**
4. **Review with supervisor** if high risk
5. **Document assessment** as required

### Common Hazards
- **Rotating propellers** - severe laceration risk
- **Electrical shock** - from batteries and power systems  
- **Chemical exposure** - from solvents and adhesives
- **Eye injury** - from debris and chemicals
- **Fire risk** - from batteries and electrical equipment

## Training Requirements

### Mandatory Training
- [ ] **General lab safety** orientation
- [ ] **Electrical safety** procedures
- [ ] **Flight operations** safety briefing
- [ ] **Emergency procedures** review
- [ ] **Equipment-specific** training as required

### Refresher Training

- **Additional training** for new equipment
- **Update training** when procedures change
- **Incident-based training** if required

## Incident Reporting

### When to Report
- **Any injury** or near-miss incident
- **Equipment damage** or malfunction
- **Safety procedure violations**
- **Environmental incidents** or spills
- **Security concerns** or breaches

### Reporting Procedure
