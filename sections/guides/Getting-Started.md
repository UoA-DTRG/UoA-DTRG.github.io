# Getting Started with DTRG

Welcome to the Drone Technology Research Group (DTRG) at the University of Auckland's Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with your project.

## Essential First Steps

### 1. Read the Safety Guidelines
**MANDATORY** before any practical work:
- Read the [General Safety Guidelines](Safety-Guidelines) thoroughly
- **ALL students must read and understand these guidelines**
- Safety is our top priority in all activities

### 2. Complete Required Safety and Access Procedures

#### Part IV Students - Risk Assessment
Before starting any practical work, Part IV students **must**:
- Complete a safety risk assessment for your project
- Use the template provided in your course materials
- Submit for supervisor approval
- Approval typically takes less than one week
- **No practical work can begin until this is approved**

#### Lab Inductions
If your work requires using lab facilities, you must:
- Contact the lab technician for the area you'll be working in
- Complete a lab induction specific to that space
- Arrange access card authorization

**Main Lab Areas:**
- **Motion Capture Room**: Contact Emanuele Romano
- **General Mechatronics Lab**: Contact relevant lab technician
- **Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel** (Newmarket Campus): Contact relevant lab technician
- Other lab spaces: Contact relevant lab technician

**How to Contact Lab Technicians:**
- **Part IV students**: Contact via Canvas
- **Other students/members**: Contact via email
- Lab technicians also arrange access cards

### 3. Join Communication Channels

**Email** - For formal communications
- Ensure you have access to DTRG email communications
- Check regularly for important updates

**WhatsApp** - For informal day-to-day communication
- **General chat**: General DTRG discussions
- **Part IV chat**: Specific to Part IV students
- **Lab space chats**: Questions and suggestions for specific lab spaces (Motion Capture, Wind Tunnel, etc.)
- Ask your supervisor or team members for invite links

### 4. Get GitHub Access
- **Managed by**: Your supervisor
- Contact your supervisor to be added to relevant repositories
- Ensure you understand the contribution processes for your project repo(s)
- **Repository Naming**: Named for the project; use branches or forks when working on an existing base
- **Branch Naming**: Use format `Name/Project-Title`
- Follow good version control practices at all times
- See [Git Basics](Git-Basics) for version control fundamentals
- See [Project Template](Project-Template) for Git workflows and best practices

### 5. Familiarize Yourself with Team Members
- Visit the **People** tab on the DTRG website to see team members
- Contact other members for help and questions
- Don't hesitate to reach out - everyone is here to help!

## Project-Specific Setup

Depending on your project, you'll need to follow specific guides:

### If Your Work Involves PX4
- See the [PX4 Getting Started Guide](../PX4/PX4-GettingStarted)
- Follow PX4 installation and configuration procedures
- Learn about flight controllers and autopilot systems

### If Your Work Involves Simulation
- See the [Simulation Pages](../Simulation)
- Set up simulation environment (Gazebo, QGroundControl, etc.)
- Practice in simulation before any hardware work

### If Your Work Involves the Wind Tunnel
- See the [Wind Tunnel Operations Guide](Wind-Tunnel)
- Contact Emanuele Romano for induction
- Plan your experiments and testing procedures

### If You're Designing Parts or UAVs
- Read the [Design Guidelines](Design-Guidelines)
- Understand manufacturing capabilities and constraints
- Follow documentation standards

### If You're Working with Specific UAVs
- Visit the [UAV Platforms page](../UAVs) to learn about specific craft
- Each UAV page contains specifications and operational information
- Understand the capabilities and limitations of your platform

## Flight Training (If Applicable)

If you'll be flying multirotor drones, you **must** complete flight training:

### Training Requirements
- Complete [Flying Training and Approval](Flying-Training-Approval) process
- Practice with a trainer pilot until approved
- Best opportunity: **Biweekly socials** (check WhatsApp/email for schedule each semester)
- Until approved, you may practice solo ONLY with designated [Training Drones](../uavs/Training-Drones)

### Approval Process
You must demonstrate:
- Safe navigation of a course
- Control proficiency with training drones
- Understanding of battery safety measures

### Fixed-Wing Aircraft
- Handled separately by **Nicholas Kay**
- Contact Nicholas for fixed-wing specific training

## Project Organization

### Teams Drive
- All projects should be organized in the relevant Teams Drive
- Create a structured folder for your project
- **Main Folders**:
  - **Resources**: Team-wide resources and documentation
  - **Project Archives**: Completed and active project files
  - **Presentation Archives**: Past presentations and reports
- See [Project Template](Project-Template) for recommended project organization

### GitHub Version Control
- Use Git repositories under the DTRG organization for code and version tracking
- Follow the project README template
- See [Project Template](Project-Template) for detailed guidelines

### Project-Specific Getting Started Guides
- Many projects have their own getting started guides
- These may include beginner-friendly tasks to help you learn
- Ask your supervisor for project-specific documentation

## Learning Resources

### DTRG Documentation
- [Safety Guidelines](Safety-Guidelines) - **Read this first!**
- [PX4 Documentation](../PX4) - Autopilot systems
- [Simulation Guide](../Simulation) - Virtual testing
- [UAV Platforms](../UAVs) - Hardware specifications
- [Design Guidelines](Design-Guidelines) - For building/designing
- [Wind Tunnel Operations](Wind-Tunnel) - Facility usage

### External Resources
